# city-skyline
For the City Skyline project, I used HTML and CSS to craft a stylized city skyline. HTML organized the components of the skyline, and CSS was used to create the skyline's aesthetic, including the arrangement of buildings and their appearances. The result was a visually engaging representation of a cityscape, showcasing my skills in design and layout composition.
